Desiree Grab.R is the main file to refer to.
This file contains 3 parts.
Part 1 processes the Test Data and creates new variables. Please rename your test file to mytestdata.csv for the code to work.
The equation to create variables is taken from https://www.instructables.com/id/Accelerometer-Gyro-Tutorial/
Part 2 prepares the training and validation data for building the model. 
I have taken the Grab data and divided it into a training set and a validation set.
If it takes too long to load the data, I have included in this repository 2 files named traindata.csv and validationdata.csv that can be loaded to build the model.
Part 3 uses the fitted model to predict on the test data.

I have included codes for K-Nearest-Neighbour, Ridge Regression, Lasso, Elastic Net, Decision Tree, Random Forest and Gradient Boosting Machine that was used on this classification problem. Each algorithm will produce an AUC value. An ensemble prediction can be created from the various probabilities generated by the algorithms.

I wanted to create variables to track bearing change, change of the Resultant force, speed change over time. However, I have yet to figure out how these variables can be coded into, possibly, a for loop.
