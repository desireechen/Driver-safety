# Safety

Desiree Grab.R is the main file to refer to.
This file contains 3 parts.
Part 1 processes the Test Data and creates new variables. Please rename your test file to mytestdata.csv for the code to work.
Part 2 prepares the training and validation data for building the model. 
I have taken the Grab data and divided it into a training set and a validation set.
If it takes too long to load the data, I have included in this repository 2 files named traindata.csv and validationdata.csv that can be loaded to build the model.
Part 3 uses the fitted model to predict on the test data.
